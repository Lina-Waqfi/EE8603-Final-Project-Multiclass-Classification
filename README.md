# EE8603-Final-Project-Multiclass-Classification
This repository explores the application of machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging the Pycaret library, for the classification of red wine quality. The dataset used for this investigation comprises physicochemical properties of red wines, and the task involves multiclass classification to predict the quality rating of each wine. Pycaret library facilitated an efficient and systematic exploration of multiple machine learning models, automating the preprocessing and model selection stages. The dataset, sourced from UCI viniculture database from the north of Portugal, offers a comprehensive representation of red wine characteristics, making it an ideal candidate for quality prediction. Results indicate that among the various classification algorithms tested, the Random Forest classifier demonstrated the best performance. This research not only contributes to the understanding of the relationship between physicochemical properties and wine quality but also underscores the utility of the Pycaret library in streamlining the machine learning workflow.
